# Object-oriented design patterns

## About this project

- This project aims to provide some implementation variations of existing design patterns for object-oriented languages to serve as a basis for studies for those who are looking for more elegant, performance-oriented forms that facilitate the maintenance of their codes.

## Environment

- Linux Ubuntu 18.10
- Java 14
- Spring Boot 2.2.7 
- Groovy 3.0.4 to BDD tests
- IDE: Eclipse, InteliJ or your preference

## Project structure

- In this project, each design pattern will be stored in a package.
- The test BDDs will also follow the same pattern and should cover all scenarios applied to each design pattern.

## How to compile the project

- As this project was created for educational purposes only, there is no need to compile outside your IDE. After preparing the environment, just analyze and run the tests to see all the scenarios in action.

## Design patterns available so far

- Strategy
  1. Simple Strategy
  2. Enum

- Factory with:
  1. Builder
  2. Generics
  3. Factory with Generics, Strategy and Flyweight
  4. Singleton

- Builder with:
  1. Generics and Reflection(Not recommended!!!)
  2. Singleton

- Flyweight with:
  1. Strategy
  
- Adapter with:
  1. Strategy
  2. Generics

- Template Method with:
  1. Strategy and Generics

# Note

- This project was developed using the Spring and Java framework. But, the techniques applied here can be applied in any programming language that is 100% object oriented.
